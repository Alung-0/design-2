/*

	JavaScript distinguishes between null, which is a value that indicates a
	deliberate non-value (and is only accessible through the null keyword), and
	undefined, which is a value of type undefined that indicates an uninitialized
	value â€” that is, a value hasn't even been assigned yet. We'll talk about
	variables later, but in JavaScript it is possible to declare a variable
	without assigning a value to it. If you do this, the variable's type is
	undefined. undefined is actually a constant.
